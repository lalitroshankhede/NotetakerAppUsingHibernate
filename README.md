# Notetaker Application 

This is a guide on how to build a Notetaker application using Java and the Hibernate framework with JDBC.

## Overview

The Notetaker application is designed to help users store and manage their notes efficiently. It utilizes the Hibernate framework with JDBC to interact with the underlying database. With this application, users can create, read, update, and delete notes, as well as perform various operations to organize and search for notes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Hibernate framework
- MSSQL 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/notetaker-application.git
   ```

2. Set up the database.

   - Create a new MSSQL database for the application.
   - Update the database configuration in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file with your database credentials.

3. Build the project using Maven.

   ```
   cd notetaker-application
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application.

   ```
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.notetaker.Application"
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it through a web browser. The following features are available:

- **Create a Note**: Provide a title, content, and optional tags to create a new note.
- **Read a Note**: View the details of a specific note by searching for it based on its ID.
- **Update a Note**: Edit the title, content, or tags of an existing note.
- **Delete a Note**: Remove a note from the system using its ID.
- **List Notes**: Retrieve a list of all notes stored in the database.

## Technologies Used

The Notetaker application is built using the following technologies:

- Java programming language
- Hibernate framework with JDBC for database interaction
- Maven for project management and dependency resolution
- MSSQL
